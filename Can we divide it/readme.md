DESCRIPTION:

Your task is to create the function `isDivideBy` (or `is_divide_by)` to check ifan integer `number` is divisible by both `a` and `b`.

A few cases:

```
(-12, 2, -6)  ->  true
(-12, 2, -5)  ->  false

(45, 1, 6)    ->  false
(45, 5, 15)   ->  true

(4, 1, 4)     ->  true
(15, -5, 3)   ->  true
```
