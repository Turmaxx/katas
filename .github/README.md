# CODE KATAS

This is repo was meant to keep solutions for katas I have done in highschool found on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com).

## What is a kata you ask?

A kata is an exercise which helps individuals hone their skils through practice, in this instance kata means programming exercises which help programmers hone their skills through practice and reptition which is found on the CodeWars Website. 

Checkout the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata#Outside_martial_arts) if you are really interested in what it means, as I was since I didn't know what it meant while i was in highschool but it reminded me of some guy in One Piece called Katakuri.
